     * We can override the toString() method:
     * 
     * Using @override Annotation:
     * Annotations, a form of metadata, provide data about a program that is not
     * part of the program itself. Annotations have no direct effect on the
     * operation of the code they annotate.
     * 
     * When overriding a method, you might want to use the @Override
     * annotation that instructs the compiler that you intend to override a method
     * in the superclass. If, for some reason, the compiler detects that the method
     * does not exist in one of the superclasses, then it will generate an error.
     * Link: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/override.html
	 
	 also notice the annotation "override":
	 - informs the compiler that the element is meant to override an element declared in a superclass. 
	 - While it is not required to use this annotation when overriding a method, it helps to prevent errors. 
	 If a method marked with @Override fails to correctly override a method in one of its superclasses, 
	 the compiler generates an error.
	 - If you donâ€™t use theis annotation, 
	 this  method will be treated as a new method in the subclass (rather than the overriding method).
